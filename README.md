# Crypto Market Data Collector and Analyzer

## Overview

This project is designed to collect and analyze cryptocurrency market data using the CoinMarketCap API. The objective is to gain insights into the crypto market by gathering real-time data, performing exploratory data analysis, and visualizing trends and patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is collected in real-time from the CoinMarketCap API. It includes various details for each cryptocurrency:
- **Name**: The name of the cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
- **Symbol**: The ticker symbol for the cryptocurrency.
- **Market Cap**: Market capitalization value.
- **Price**: Current price in USD.
- **Volume (24h)**: Trading volume in the last 24 hours.
- **Percent Change**: Price change percentage over different time intervals (1h, 24h, 7d).

## Installation

To run this project, make sure Python is installed, and install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn requests
```

Additionally, you'll need an API key from CoinMarketCap to access market data.

## API Setup

1. Register on the [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) website.
2. Obtain an API key by subscribing to a plan.
3. Create a file named `config.py` in the project directory and add your API key:

```python
# config.py
API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
```

Ensure you replace `'your_api_key_here'` with the actual API key from CoinMarketCap.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect cryptocurrency data using the CoinMarketCap API.
   - Store the data in a structured format using Pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Clean the collected data by handling missing values and formatting numerical data for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize market trends, distribution of prices, and market caps.
   - Analyze price changes over different time intervals.

### Example Usage

Below is an example of how to start the data collection in a Python environment:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import requests
from config import API_KEY

# Example API request setup
url = 'https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest'
headers = {
    'Accepts': 'application/json',
    'X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY': API_KEY,
}

# Fetch and display data
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
crypto_data = response.json()
```

Ensure your API key is set up correctly in the `config.py` file before running the code.

## Analysis

### Data Exploration
- **Top Cryptocurrencies by Market Cap**: Analyze the largest cryptocurrencies by their market capitalization.
- **Price Distribution**: Explore the price range of cryptocurrencies and identify outliers.
- **Volume Analysis**: Examine the trading volume to determine which cryptocurrencies are the most actively traded.

### Trend Analysis
- Analyze the percentage change in prices over different periods (1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days) to detect market trends.
- Visualize the volatility and stability of various cryptocurrencies using time-based data.

## Results

Key insights from the analysis include:
- **Market Cap Dominance**: Identification of top cryptocurrencies leading the market by market cap.
- **Price Trends**: Analysis of short-term and long-term price movements.
- **Trading Volume**: Understanding of trading activity and liquidity in the market.
- **Volatility Patterns**: Insights into the volatility of different cryptocurrencies, aiding in investment decisions.

## Acknowledgements
